    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, the script kicks off by importing a couple of key libraries: `feedparser` and `psycopg2`. The `feedparser` library is used to pull in and parse those RSS feeds, which makes retrieving articles a breeze. On the other hand, `psycopg2` is our go-to for connecting to a PostgreSQL database, letting us easily save our articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define a dictionary called `categories` that groups different news types into categories based on some relevant keywords. We’ve got categories like \"Terrorism / protest / political unrest / riot,\" \"Positive/Uplifting,\" and \"Natural Disasters.\" Each category has a list of keywords that help us figure out where each article fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifying Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here’s where the magic happens. We’ve got a function called `classify_article` that takes a piece of text (like an article title) and checks it against our keyword lists. It’s pretty straightforward: if it finds any of the keywords in the text, it returns the associated category. If nothing matches, it just goes with \"Others.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we’re set up with our categories, the script connects to the PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials (like username, password, and so on). This connection is crucial because we’ll be storing our articles there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing RSS Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "The script also has a list of RSS feed URLs from which it pulls articles. It goes through each URL, parsing the feeds with `feedparser`. For every feed, it digs into the entries (or articles) and extracts important details like the title, link, and published date. If any of these are missing, it fills in with a default value like \"No title.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Unique IDs and Classifying\n",
    "\n",
    "To make each article unique, the script generates an ID by combining the feed index and the entry index. Then it classifies the article using the earlier defined function. This step helps us categorize the articles based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing in the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is the part where the script tries to insert the article data into the database. It does this using an SQL `INSERT` statement that includes the article's ID, title, link, published date, and the category we just assigned. If there’s a conflict—like if the same link is already in the database—it updates the existing record instead of creating a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Committing Changes and Handling Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "After each successful insertion or update, the script commits those changes to the database, making sure everything is saved. And, of course, it has error handling in place. If something goes wrong during the insertion, it prints an error message to help troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapping Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when everything is done, the script closes the database connection and cleans up. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
